# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you agree to and accept these terms. ✨

## 1. Service Overview

The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers! 🚀

## 2. User Registration & Accounts

*   Users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   Users are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account allowed!** 🙅‍♀️
*   The Site has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. Play by the rules, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

*   Our subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with fees clearly shown on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed securely through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, the Site never stores your payment info! 🛡️
*   Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Easy peasy!
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase date. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required. So, choose wisely! 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property

*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization! 🙏
*   Users get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading only. Keep it for your own awesome growth! 🌱
*   If you're eyeing commercial use or need to cite a lot, just reach out to us for permission. We're friendly!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

*   **Do not** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep it positive! 🚫
*   **No bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking** member content through technical means. That's a big no-no! 😠
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Seriously, don't test us! ⛔

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just giving you a heads-up! 🔄
*   If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, the Site **won't be liable for compensation**. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control! 🤷‍♂️

## 7. Disclaimer

*   Information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always double-check with a pro! 💡
*   The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk!

## 8. Governing Law

*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Keep it legal, folks!
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should try to resolve them amicably first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🙏
